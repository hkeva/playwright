# Playwright

This project aims to explore Playwright as a popular testing tool. Playwright offers powerful capabilities for automating browser interactions, enabling efficient and comprehensive testing of web applications.

### `npm install` or `yarn`

## Running Tests

You can execute all test cases at once by running the command:

### `npx playwright test`

To run specific test files, use the following command structure:
